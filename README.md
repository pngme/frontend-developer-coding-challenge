## üöÄ Challenge Overview

Your task is to build a **Stock Price Viewer** using React and the [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/). The app should allow users to search for a stock by its symbol (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple) and view real-time stock price information.

### Requirements:

1. **Search for Stock Data:**
   - Create an input field where users can type a stock symbol (e.g., "AAPL").
   - Fetch real-time stock data from the Alpha Vantage API.
   
2. **Display Stock Information:**
   - Show the following stock information:
     - Stock symbol
     - Current price
     - Daily high, low, and close prices
   
3. **Error Handling:**
   - Display appropriate error messages when the stock symbol is invalid or if there are issues fetching the data from the API.
   
4. **Loading State:**
   - Include a loading state while the data is being fetched from the API.
